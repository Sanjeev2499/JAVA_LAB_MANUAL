#Student Record Management System

 Problem Statement
 Create a Student Record Management System that allows users to input, display, and calculate grades
 for students. The system uses Object-Oriented Programming in Java to manage student data such as
 roll number, name, course, marks, and grade.
 Objectives- Implement OOP concepts such as classes, objects, and methods- Use constructors, control structures, arrays/ArrayList, and input/output- Apply conditional statements and loops- Calculate grades based on marks
 
 Learning Outcomes
 1. Understand fundamentals of object-oriented programming
 2. Implement constructors and methods in Java
 3. Work with arrays and strings
 4. Use loops and conditions to control program flow


 Class Hierarchy
 Person (Base Class)
- name (String)
 Student (Derived from Person)
 Fields:
- rollNo (int)
- name (String)
- course (String)
- marks (double)
-  grade (char)
Methods:
- inputDetails()
- displayDetails()
- calculateGrade()
 Data Types Used
- String
- int
- double
- char
 Program Operations
 1. Add Student
 2. Display All Students
 3. Exit
 Grade Calculation Rule- A : 90–100- B : 75–89- C : 60–74- D : Below 60
